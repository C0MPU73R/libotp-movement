libotp-movement
===========
This repository contains ready-to-use movement code reverse-engineered from libotp.dll.

Used to control the movement of pets (Doodles) in Disney's Toontown Online. Was likely also used in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean Online, however as far as I know there is no concrete evidence to support this.

### Usage ###
If you are using this within a Toontown or Pirates Online project, just import the classes from `libotp`. If you have a previous implementation of the modules contained within this repository, make sure to remove them and, if necessary, change your imports and remove any related code modifications.

### Contributing ###
We welcome all potential contributors.
